# AirBnB_data_project
Ipynb analyzing a dataset about Airbnbs in Berlin

This is a university project. We analyzed data about the Airbnb market in Berlin. 
In the data folder, the used csvs can be found.
In the notebook folder, the task(in german language) and my code can be found.

I do not own the data used. The data is owned by the TechAcademy initiative (tech-academy.io).
